Ticket Booking Web Application

This is a Java-based Ticket Booking Web Application built using a modular Gradle project structure. The application manages ticket booking operations through structured service and entity layers, with local data storage handled via JSON files (trains.json and users.json). It uses the Gradle build system for dependency management and project execution, and is configured to run seamlessly in IntelliJ IDEA. The project demonstrates practical implementation of Java application architecture, service-layer logic, and file-based data handling.
